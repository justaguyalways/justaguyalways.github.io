_Welcome to my homepage._

Hello! I’m Poornash Anandan Sangeetha (often going by A S Poornash), a final-year B.Tech student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Patna](https://www.iitp.ac.in/).

Currently, I serve as a Research Assistant at the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu) in the [ODDS Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/group/) led by [Prof. Meisam Razaviyayn](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/). This role grew out of the prestigious _Indo-U.S. Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF)-Viterbi Summer Research Program_ at the [USC Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu), where I focused on Trustworthy Machine Learning. I am fortunate to have [Prof. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/) as my thesis advisor at IIT Patna, where I’m working on research problems in NLP and multimodal systems. I have also collaborated with [Prof. Kitsuchart Pasupa](https://www.it.kmitl.ac.th/~kitsuchart/) (King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Thailand) on research related to low-resource languages like Thai. You can find the papers corresponding to these collaborations on the [Publications page](/publications).

My research interests span natural language processing, multimodal learning, and machine learning, with a focus on building trustworthy and fair systems. I have worked on advancing methods for toxicity detection, addressing challenges in multilingual and low-resource language settings, and exploring effective multimodal alignment methods. My work includes contributions to privacy-preserving and fair learning in decentralized environments, as well as improving readability and relevance in summarization systems. Additionally, I am interested in the intersection of vision and language, particularly in tasks requiring robust cross-modal alignment and reasoning.

Some relatively non-academic things about me - 
* I am an avid puzzle solver and pursue [speedcubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) in a competitive manner. ([My WCA profile link](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2017ANAN08))
* I am also a volunteer in the National Service Scheme (NSS) community at IIT Patna, participating in cleanliness drives and teaching Mathematics at a nearby public primary school.
* Quite a philosopher myself. Speak 4 languages.
