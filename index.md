_Welcome to my homepage._

Hello! I’m Poornash Anandan Sangeetha (often going by A S Poornash), an incoming M.S. student in Machine Learning at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/), USA (2025-2027). I recently graduated as the Institute Topper (President’s Gold Medalist) in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Patna (IIT Patna)](https://www.iitp.ac.in/), with a GPA of 9.71/10.

I served as a Machine Learning Intern at [Amazon Applied Science](https://www.amazon.science/) (Jan-Jul 2025), where I developed automated workflows for vision-language product matching, achieving over 90% reduction in manual review time and significant gains in classification metrics. Before this, I worked as a researcher in the [ODDS Research Group](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/group/) at the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Meisam Razaviyayn](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/), focusing on private, fair, and federated machine learning, as part of the competitive [IUSSTF-Viterbi India Scholar program](https://iusstf.org/iusstf-viterbi-program).

At [IIT Patna](https://www.iitp.ac.in/), I completed my undergraduate thesis under [Prof. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/) and worked on research problems in NLP and multimodal learning (including projects accepted at conferences and journals like ACL, ACM Multimedia, AAAI, CIKM and, IEEE TCSS). I also collaborated with [Prof. Kitsuchart Pasupa](https://www.it.kmitl.ac.th/~kitsuchart/) (KMITL, Thailand) on hate speech detection for low-resource languages like Thai.

My research interests span natural language processing, multimodal learning, privacy-preserving and fair ML, and trustworthy systems. I have worked on advancing techniques for toxicity detection (especially in code-mixed and multilingual videos), learning in decentralized or low-resource environments, and designing practical interventions for real-world multimodal systems.

Further details and papers are available on my [Publications page](/publications).

Some relatively non-academic things about me - 
* I am an avid puzzle solver and pursue [speedcubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) in a competitive manner. ([My WCA profile link](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2017ANAN08))
* Quite a philosopher myself. Speak 4 languages.
